SUBJ1	A	B	C
SUBJ2	C	A	B
SUBJ3	B	C	A
SUBJ4	A	B	C

SUBJ10	A	B	C

# For congruent vs. incogruent disc trials: we expect more top-down? difference between performances = top-down control?
# Arousal/Emotion Test for Distractors: Ask Aurelie about it
# We'll run the same statistical tests she ran in her experiment. 
# Response window = 1000s (too much?)
# Set global attenuation = 0.35?
