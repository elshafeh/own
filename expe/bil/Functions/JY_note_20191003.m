% 1. Function "genBandpassFilteredNoise2freq" is created. This would allow
% us to generate noise patches containing information from both frequencies
% specified.
%
% 2. When I'm working on this, I noticed that the spatial frequencies used
% were both low. Ideally, we might want the 2 stimuli frequencies to be 
% around 5 cpd,with one on the left (e.g., 4 cpd) and the other on the 
% right (e.g., 6 cpd). This would help to "equate" the sensitivity in 
% response to the 2 types of stimuli. This is of course coming from the
% perspective of a "hard-core" vision scientist, so it is at most personal
% preference/suggestion (see REF for the contrast sensitivity function).

% 3. Please feel free to let me know if we wanna get together to give a 2nd
% thought on the parameters or settings :)
